// Coding Challenge #1

/*
Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI
(Body Mass Index), which is calculated using 
the formula: BMI = mass / height ** 2 = 
mass / (height * height).
(mass in kg and height in meter).

1. Store Mark's and John's mass and 
height in variables
2. Calculate both their BMIs 
using the formula (you can even implement 
both versions)
3. Create a boolean 
variable 'markHigherBMI' 
containing information about whether Mark 
has a higher BMI than John.

TEST DATA 1: Marks weights 78 kg 
and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg 
and is 1.95 m tall.
TEST DATA 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88
 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76 m tall.

GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€
